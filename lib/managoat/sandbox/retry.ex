defmodule Managoat.Sandbox.Retry do

  Bounded exponential backoff for **idempotent** external calls.

  A transient Sprites blip used to fail provisioning outright: sandbox marked
  `failed`, conversation marked `failed`, user retries by hand (#168). Steps
  that are safe to repeat now retry a couple of times before giving up.

  The contract is idempotency, and the retry policy leans on it: an *unknown*
  error shape is retried, because for an idempotent call the cost of a
  pointless retry is milliseconds, while the cost of misclassifying a
  transient transport error as permanent is a failed conversation. Only errors
  that are provably permanent — an HTTP 4xx other than 429 — are not retried.

  Never wrap a non-idempotent call (spawning a runtime turn, a git clone into
  a non-empty directory) in this.

  Runs `fun`, retrying on retriable failure with exponential backoff + jitter.

  Retries when `fun` returns `{:error, reason}` with a retriable reason, or
  when it raises (unknown raises are treated as transient, per the moduledoc). Anything else `fun` returns passes through
  untouched. When attempts are exhausted the last error tuple is returned, or
  the last exception re-raised, so call sites keep their existing semantics.

  Options:
    * `:attempts` — total attempts, default #{@default_attempts}
    * `:base_ms` — first delay, default 250 (test config sets it to 1)
    * `:max_ms` — delay ceiling, default #{@default_max_ms}
    * `:label` — for the retry log line
    * `:retriable?` — override the `transient?/1` classifier
