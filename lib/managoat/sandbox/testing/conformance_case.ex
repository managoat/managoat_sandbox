defmodule Managoat.Sandbox.ConformanceCase do
  @moduledoc """
  The executable form of the `Managoat.Sandbox` contract: a shared suite
  every adapter must pass.

  It lives under `lib/`, not `test/support`, on purpose: it is compiled in
  every environment so that an adapter written *outside* this package (a
  host's self-hosted runner, a fourth vendor) can `use` it from its own test
  suite. A `test/support` module would exist only while this package runs
  its own tests. `ExUnit` is part of Elixir, so shipping the macros costs a
  consumer nothing.

  Usage:

      defmodule Managoat.Sandbox.FakeConformanceTest do
        use Managoat.Sandbox.ConformanceCase,
          adapter: Managoat.Sandbox.Fake,
          fixtures: %{
            exec_ok: {"emit", ["out:hello"], "hello"},
            exec_fail: {"emit", ["out:oops", "exit:3"], 3},
            spawn_ok: {"emit", ["out:hello", "exit:0"]},
            spawn_drop: {"emit", ["out:partial", "drop"]},
            spawn_stay: {"emit", ["out:ready", "stay"]}
          }

        setup do
          Managoat.Sandbox.Fake.reset()
          :ok
        end
      end

  `fixtures` supplies the adapter-appropriate command vocabulary (the Fake
  speaks its scripted instructions; a live adapter would use `bash -lc`), and
  an optional `name: {Mod, :fun, args}` mints sandbox names when the adapter
  needs a particular shape:

    * `exec_ok` — `{cmd, args, expected_stdout}`, exits 0
    * `exec_fail` — `{cmd, args, nonzero_exit_code}`
    * `spawn_ok` — emits some stdout then exits 0
    * `spawn_drop` — the transport closes without an exit frame (optional;
      pins the closes-without-exit-reads-as-zero rule)
    * `spawn_stay` — emits stdout then stays alive until stdin EOF
      (needed for the write-totality and attach-replay tests)

  Semantics pinned here and nowhere else: create idempotency, the
  not-found/transient distinction, destroy tolerance, full-view listing,
  exec-never-raises with nonzero-exit-as-data, the owner-message frame
  contract with exactly one terminal frame, stdin-write totality (#603),
  attach replay-from-start, and suspend/resume totality.
